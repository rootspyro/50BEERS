# 50 BEERS: The Challenge

In Onctober 2023 I traveled to Spain for 3 months to visit my sister, during this trip a good friend of mine challenged me to taste 50 different beers.

Over the course of those three months I was tasting and documenting more than 50 beers as well as different alcoholic beverages in a diary. Since then I have continued with this hobby and have decided to digitize the content and essence of this diary in the format of a blog.

Likewise in this repository I document how I build this blog.

## Project Parts

This project is divided on three parts:

- [The Blog Site](./blog)
- [The Admin Dashboard]()
- [The API Restful](./backend)
